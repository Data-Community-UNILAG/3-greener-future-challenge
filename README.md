# {Challenge name} - Mini Data Challenge #{id}

Brought to you by the Data Community UNILAG

## Challenge Overview

Analyze the {Dataset name} dataset to {}. {more info}

### Tasks

#### Part 1: ML Model

- Build a machine learning model to predict {} based on the available features. (neural networks are not allowed)

- At the end of your submission, write a function named `predict_{}` that takes in new {} data and returns their {}. (Jupyter notebooks are also accepted).

#### Part 2: Analysis

From your analysis, answer the following questions:

- {What/How/Who/Where/Why} {question}?

## Submission Guidelines

### Timeline

- **Challenge Release:** {date}
- **Submission Deadline:** {date} (11:59 PM)
- **Winner Announcement:** Someday between {} and {} depending on the number of submissions.

### Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy:** Evaluation of your model's predictions (40%).
- **Analysis:** Depth of analysis and insights (40%).
- **Clarity:** Clear presentation of findings and visualizations (20%).

For accuracy, aim for less than the baseline which is a root mean squared error (RMSE) of around {}. This is gotten from a model that predicts {} for all students.

### Get Started

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
3. _(optional)_ Create a virtual environment and install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Complete the challenge and include:
   - Your code (only Python will be accepted, that is, either `submission.ipynb` or `submission.py`).
   - A summary of your findings (`summary.md`).
   - (Optional) Any visualizations (e.g., `.png`, `.pdf`) in the `visualizations` folder.
   - (Optional) `requirements.txt`
5. **Submit your work** by creating a branch named `submission-[your-name]` and opening a pull request.
